# learnxor
XOR function is important to the community of machine learning for historical reasons. The field was set on hold as people found out with a single layer network even XOR function cannot be learned. However, with slightly deeper networks and a little non-linearity, we are able to learn XOR. in this repo, we want to make sure that it is the case.
